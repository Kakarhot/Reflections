When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You can share it with other people or let othre people contribute to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote might be changed by someone else and you don't want to have that change in your computer.
