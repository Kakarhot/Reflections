How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

One can compare two files easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If the recent change of the file does not work, he can go back to the previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros are you can choose when to commit exactly as you want, cons is you may forget to commit sometimes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git treat each file as a part of the whole project, while others like Google Docs treats each file separetely.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log lists all the changes made to the repository, git diff compares two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You can always go back to the previous version if something goes wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Use version control on my own code
